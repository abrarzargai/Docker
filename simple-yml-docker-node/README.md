# Dockerized Backend Service

This is a simple example of how to Dockerize a backend service using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine.

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   ```sh
   git clone repository_name
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory
   ```sh
   cd project-directory
   cd simple-yml-docker-node
   ```

### Start the Service

3. Start the Service
   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This command will build the Docker image and start the service.

### Access the Service

4. Open your web browser and go to:

   ```sh
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Stop the Service

To stop the service, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where docker-compose up is running.
